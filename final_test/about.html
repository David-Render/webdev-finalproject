                    Hi y'all I'm David, the creator of the site, and I want to start this about page by talking about where I come from in the world of extreme sports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was a kid that enjoyed doing sports that others often found "extreme". <br>
                    The thrill of roller coasters, riding jet skis, or just riding a skateboard brought me so much joy growing up. <br>
                    As I got older, I got into snowboarding, roller skating, surfing, bmx, among others and I found myself learning to master these sports but always looking for something new.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="mission" class="anchor-target content-box">
                <h1>What we do</h1>
                <p>
                    The mission for this page is to bring that joy I felt as a kid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That mix of childhood joy and adventure mixed with the escape from reality. <br>
                    That moment when you forget about everything else and just actually live, that's the goal. <br>
                    The hope for the is that everyone can come together, share stories, meet people, and just bask in the adrenaline rush you'll get.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="creator" class="anchor-target content-box">
                <h1>Meet our "Steve Jobs"</h1>
                <p>
                    Howdy. As I said before, I'm David and I'm currently a CS student about to graduate. <br>
                    Yes, I know. I'm going to be jobless and will make more money being a garbage man with this job market. <br>
                    My entire hobbies revolve around extreme sports and I can't get enough of them. My free time is either sports or hitting the gym. Everything else is project time. <br>
                    I hope you enjoy the page!
                </p>

            <section id="team" class="anchor-target content-box">
                <h1>Meet our Team</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Rocky (Ricky) -> </strong> Our team's biggest rock climber. <br>
                    Rocky is a bouldering master having actually climbed V15's and flies through climbs that I (David) struggle with.
                    He's the mastermind for most of the Rock climing side of this site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>River (Banks) -> </strong> Our team's gnarliest surfer. <br>
                    This guy is probably the biggest insitagtor I know. This bro had me going from surfing 3 foot waves to 8 footers.
                    Gave me the scariest and best surfing experience ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, our team includes at least one person you know.<br>
                    <b>YOU!</b><br>
                    Our "team" is the community, everyone who shows up and decides to be a part of the experience.
